The following changes were made in the project settings:
	For smoother (ball) movement:
	- Physics Interpolation was set to true
	- Physics Jitter Fix was set to 0, as required by Physics Interpolation
	
	As a possible solution(?) to prevent collision problems with the ball:
	- Physics Tics Per Second were increased from 60 to 120 

	To prevent the ball from stopping:
	- Default Linear Damp set to 0
	- Default Angular Damp set to 0
